-- Given a blacklist B containing unique integers from [0, N), write a function to return a uniform random integer from [0, N) which is NOT in B.

-- Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to systemâ€™s Math.random().

-- Approach:
-- Define a bijection f between [0, N) and all the allowed numbers
-- Use system.random to generate random number in range [0, m) where m is total number of allowed numbers
