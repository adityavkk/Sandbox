/* Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices
 * i and j, inclusive.
 *
 * The update(i, val) function modifies nums by updating the element at index i
 * to val.
 *
 * Note: - the array is only modifiable by the update function.
 *       - you may assume the number of calls to update and sumRange is distributed
 *         evenly
