"""
Consider the problem of finding the shortest path between two points on a plane that has
convex polygonal obstacles as shown in Figure 3.31.
This is an idealization of the problem that a robot has to solve to navigate in a crowded
environment.

C. Define the necessary functions to implement the search problem, including an ACTIONS
function that takes a vertex as input and returns a set of vectors, each of which maps the
current vertex to one of the vertices that can be reached in a straight line

(Do not forget the neighbor on the same polygon.) Use the straight-line distance for the heuristic function.

D. Apply one or more of the algorithms in this chapter to solve a range of the problems
in the domain, and comment on their performance.
